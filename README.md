# gCloud-speech-to-text
scripts for using gCloud speech-to-text on interviews and taking that output and running it into a modified version of oTranscribe (also on my github). The modified version of oTranscribe highlights the auto generated text like it was karaoke.

How To Use:

first run
    node gcloudProcessInterview.js <personName>
second run
    node createOtrWithWordstamp.js <personName>
third open the <personName>.otr file with the modified version of oTranscribe (on my github)
